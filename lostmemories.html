									<h2>Lost Memories</h2>
									<p>This is an interactive (almost educational) game that implements real-world examples of Erik Erikson's  8 Psychological Stages through 5 fun Chapters each containing its own story! Play as Aizza,  a lost girl going through her memories! </p>
								</header>
								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>	This passion project started as an experiment with a new game engine called GB Studio, a Gameboy game engine. In the early stages of development, I had an idea for what I wanted the story to incorporate which is the stages of Life. When I was taking dual enrollment English 101n & 102 I remember my professor discussing that there were stages in an individual’s life just like the seasons in a year. Ever since then I have always found that perspective as profound and unique. I believed this would make for good gameplay and as I did more research I discovered Erik Erickson’s psychological stages. I was intrigued by these 2 concepts and further experimented and implemented these aspects into what is now known as Lost Memories. 
								</p>
								<p>During my Computer Information Systems course, my classmates, Iman Jones, Mark Minkins, and I decided to utilize this unfinished project for our class project. The project was semester-long.  Our team consisted of 3 people, Iman Jones, the writer and co-game designer, Mark Minkins, writer, and quality tester, and myself, the project manager, lead game designer, and developer. We would plan and develop this project while implementing Agile principles through 4 main cycles: planning, design & development, quality assurance, and deployment. </p>
								<section>

										<h2>Planning</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										One of the first things we used to plan for our game was the Agile model. The agile model is a system development life cycle model that is used for iterative development and has 5 stages. These include brainstorming, design, development, quality assurance, and deployment. All of these steps were used throughout our project to make our transition from each step smooth and efficient. When brainstorming for our game, we asked “What is Lost Memories”, “Who are we catering to”, “What software are we going to use to develop this product”, “where will our product be accessed”, and “what is the price of our product”. Some of the development questions we answered were “who are the characters”, “what steps will be created to create the prototype”, “where will our product be accessed”, and “what is our market strategy”. For the planning period, we took a systems analyst approach to this project by not only applying Agile principles but developing documents and charts including UML Model, Project Charter, Use Case Diagram, Context Diagram, and a Gantt Chart.

									<!--Project Charter-->
									<section>
										<h4>Project Charter</h4>
										<iframe src="lm docs\LM_ProjectCharter_TEAM.docx.pdf" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>
										<p>	A project charter is a formal, typically brief document that describes your entire project, including its objectives, how it will be carried out, and who the stakeholders are. Utilizing this document any person should get a brief overview of what Lost Memories is and our objectives of this project. 
										</p>
									</section>

									<!--Use Case Diagram-->
									<section>
										<h4>Use Case Diagram</h4>
										<a href="#" class="image centered"><img src="lm docs\UseCaseDiagram.PNG" alt="" style="width:400px;height:400px;"/></a>
										<p>	This diagram is to displays the options and process of how the player interacts with our game.
										</p>
									</section>

									<!--Context Diagram-->
									<section>
										<h4>Context Diagram</h4>
										<a href="#" class="image centered"><img src="lm docs\ContextDiagram.PNG" alt="" style="width:300;height:300px;"/></a>
										<p>Context diagrams are used to clarify the boundaries of the software system. So in this diagram shows is displaying the process of how our gamer how will access our game, Lost Memories.

										<h2>Design & Development</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										After the planning stage, we worked on the dialogue of Lost Memories and how it correlates to Erik Erickson Psychological Stages. Each chapter in Lost Memories features the following stages:
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Chapter  0: Infancy and Early Childhood</li>
										<li>Chapter 1: Preschool and School Age</li>
										<li>Chapter 2: Adolescence and Young Adult</li>
										<li>Chapter 3: Middle Adulthood </li>
										<li>Chapter 4: Maturity</li>
									</ol>

									  </video>
									<p>
										This chapter implements the first two stages of Erik Erikson's Psychological Stages: Infancy and Early Childhood. The player is greeted with open arms representing the mother or caretaker of a child's life opening warm hands to comfort and talk care of them. Questions regarding trust and autonomy will be asked such as: Can I trust you?, Who are you? and others. 
										There are 2 key components of Chapter 0 are the title screen and the mysterious hands that talk to the player. The Chapter 0 Title Screen is to ensure the player of where they are regarding the story. In this case, Chapter 0 is equivalent to a prologue. The title screen for Chapter 0 displays the keyhole of the book with a lock on it from the perspective of the reader(aka the player) is peeking to open the book. In Chapter 0, the player is greeted with these big opening hands. To give a sense of comfort but the nails and color scheme makes the player feel a sense of mystery and curiosity about what’s happening.
									</p>

									<!--Chapter 1 Demo-->
									<h3>Chapter 1:Springs</h3>
									<video width="400" controls>
										<source src="videos\LM Chapter 1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										Your browser does not support HTML video.
									  </video>
									<p>
										Chapter 1 takes place in a garden and withholds three stories each implementing a different psychological stage: preschool, school age, and (early) adolescence. These stages are each incorporated into 3 separate stories. 2 key components arecanThere are 2 key components that are important to mention: the title screen and the gameplay. The title screen for Chapter 1 and all others ask the player questions regarding the story. This is when the player is first able to move around as Aizza. The player can go through the garden to unlock and go through different memories. 
									</p>

									<!--Chapter 2 Demo-->
									<h3>Chapter 2:Summer</h3>
									<video width="400" controls>
										<source src="videos\LM Chapter 2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
									  </video>
									<p>
										This chapter takes place in the Summer which represents Aizzas coming of age. This stage implements two stories each incorporating a psychological stage: (late) Adolescence and young adult. The Chapter 2 title screen is represented through the perspective of someone(in this case the player) reading a book and is halfway complete. This title screen also asks questions regarding what was discussed in Chapter 1 such as “are you a good person” and “who are you trying to be”. The setting takes place at a boardwalk to represent one of the biggest themes of Summer. Which are the beach and boardwalk. Aizza will be guided down the boardwalk and led astray to the stores on the boardwalk which will trigger her (lost) memories. 
									</p>

									<!--Chapter 3 Demo-->
									<h3>Chapter 3:Autumn</h3>
									<video width="400" controls>
										<source src="videos\LM Chapter 3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
									  </video>
									<p>
										In chapter 3 of Lost Memories, we dive into the generativity vs. stagnation stage. The theme is Fall/Autumn, which is the third phase of the Seasons of Life. This is incorporated into one coherent story to ask the question of “Will I provide something of real value?”. The Chapter 3 title screen is represented through the perspective of someone(in this case the player) reading a book and is almost complete. This title screen also asks questions regarding what was discussed in Chapter 2 such as “where are you going in life” Aizza is now in the middle of Autumn and that means she is at the warm grassy park. She experiences two lost memories with the possibilities of them representing stagnation in her life or generativity.
									</p>
									
									<!--Chapter 4 Demo-->
									<h3>Chapter 4:Winter</h3>
									<video width="400" controls>
										<source src="videos\LM Chapter 4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
									  </video>
									<p>
										This is the final chapter of Lost Memories and the last stage of the psychological stages: Maturity. For this chapter, the twist is that the player is in the present and surviving through a blizzard in the woods. Winter is represented for the maturity stage because most things like in nature decrease during these harsh conditions and this happens before the rebirth that is Spring. Unlike the previous title screens, Chapter 4 title screen displays the scenery of the scene which is a tree practically covered in snow by the blizzard approaching. The scene for the last chapter is a blizzard to represent the death that happens in the harsh Winter. At this point in the story, Aizza is an old lady and is reaching the end of her story. As she walks to her cabin in the woods she reminisces about her life.

										<h2>Quality Assurance & Deployment</h2>
									</header>
									<p>	During this stage, we reached out to find beta testers via email, text message, and social media. We emailed all beta testers every 1-2 days on what should be done and what we expect from them and received various questions and responses from our beta testers. We then and still are analyzing and looking over user feedback from beta testers through surveys and comments.									</p>
